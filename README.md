# Algorand-ASAs-Min-Balance
Script that fetches and counts algorand addresses with a minimum balance of an ASA.

"""
Simple UI that fetches and counts algorand addresses with a quantity of an ASA above a threshold 

When run as a script, the user will be prompted to inpur the Algorand ASA ID.  Then, it will return
some information of the asset, including the asset name. Thereafter it prompts the user to input
the balance threshold of interest.  It will fetch the results, and print the time elapsed and 
the number of addresses with an ASA balance greater than the input.
